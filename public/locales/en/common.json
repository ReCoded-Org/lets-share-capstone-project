Research has identified a link between making a donation to charity and increased activity in the area of the brain that registers pleasure - proving that as the old adage goes, it really is far better to give than to receive.",
            "causeText2": "Having the power to improve the lives of others is, to many people, a privilege, and one that comes with its own sense of obligation. Acting on these powerful feelings of responsibility is a great way to reinforce our own personal values and feel like we're living in a way that is true to our own ethical beliefs.",
            "causeText3": "3-Sharing the experience of donating to charity with your children shows them from a young age that they can make positive changes in the world. Children naturally love to help others, so nurturing their innate generosity is likely to mean that they grow up with a greater appreciation of what they have, and will carry on supporting charity in years to come."

Some of us were eager about front-end development, the others preferred back-end development so we were separated into two groups. We have learned valuable skills and integrated our passion for coding with the technical skills that we were taught and became web developers. In August 2022, This website was done officially. It was a result of our teamwork and hard work over the past months and evidence of our persistence."
