Research has identified a link between making a donation to charity and increased activity in the area of the brain that registers pleasure - proving that as the old adage goes, it really is far better to give than to receive.",

Acting on these powerful feelings of responsibility is a great way to reinforce our own personal values and feel like we're living in a way that is true to our own ethical beliefs.",

Children naturally love to help others, so nurturing their innate generosity is likely to mean that they grow up with a greater appreciation of what they have, and will carry on supporting charity in years to come."

We have learned valuable skills and integrated our passion for coding with the technical skills that we were taught and became web developers. In August 2022, This website was done officially. It was a result of our teamwork and hard work over the past months and evidence of our persistence."

        "contentBlg1": "\n\r1.There are financial benefits when you donate.\n\rDid you know that donating to charity can save you money come tax time?\n\rWhen you donate to a registered charity, you will receive a tax receipt for your donation. Your receipt can then be submitted with your annual tax return to receive a tax credit of up to 53 percent of your donation!  A big contribution could mean big savings on your taxes, and we think that’s a big reason why you should donate to charity!\n\r2.Teach kids the importance of giving.\n\rTeaching children to care about others is an important life lesson. When children watch you give, they will grow up knowing that giving back is the right thing to do and follow in your footsteps. So, donating also helps you be a good role model.\n\r3.Giving promotes feelings of happiness.\n\rHelping others feels good. When you donate that is important to you, you not only help people continue their vital work, but you’re also improving your emotional well-being, a win-win situation!\n\r4.Donating gives you the opportunity to show gratitude.\n\rLife is busy, and it can sometimes be easy to forget to show your gratitude for all that you’ve been given. When you are ready to give and support you can contact us, this can remind us of all that we have, and the act of donating is a way to express our feelings of gratitude.",
        "headerBlg2": "Why donating is better than recycling?",
        "contentBlg2": "Recycling refers to the process of converting waste into reusable materials whereas donating refers to give money or goods to help a person. While donating we can not only reuse the waste materials but also help the needy. So, donating creates more impact than recycling.\n\r Let’s take a scenario of paper recycling, where all the old books and newspapers are recycled, and the material obtained is made into a new paper and further used.\n\r This reduces the amount of waste produced and helps in sustainable development. If we donate the money gained from recycling to the needy people, then it creates a great influence on the people and would be a great initiative to be taken by everyone. Not all things can be easily recycled but can be donated!! We can donate books, clothes, electronic devices, and many others which may not be so important for us but are valuable to the ones who are in need.\n\r These donations will bring a smile to their faces which is the greatest gift anyone can get in return.\n\r“Remember that the happiest people are not those getting more, but those giving more!!” The secret of happiness lies in helping others so donate, be happy and make others happier!!!",
        "headerBlg3": "What should I do before donating my device?",
        "contentBlg3": "\n\r1.Back it up. Be sure to back up your documents, photos, and other important information. Or transfer this data to your new device. This way you won’t lose it. To back up your data, you can make a copy in a physical location, such as on an external hard drive or thumb drive. Or you can make a copy that is stored in the “cloud,” or online, in a secure location.\n\r2.Erase it. Once you’ve backed up the data you want to save, make sure you’ve deleted everything on your old device. This includes your download folder, photos, and the search history on your internet browser. You should clear your browsing history, cookies and site data, and cached files and images.\n\r3.Don’t forget about your apps. Delete all of your apps. This includes deleting app cache and data.\n\r4.Wipe your hard drive. Deleting things like files from your device doesn’t mean they’ve been completely erased. Remember to completely wipe your hard drive as well.\n\r5.Do a factory reset. Follow the device manufacturer’s instructions and do a factory reset, which should eliminate anything left on your device. ",
